# Intro to the BootStrap CSS Framework

---

- Personally, I don't like to do CSS and I hope no one else does too. So a better alternative is to use a CSS framework.

- One of the most popular one is BootStrap. It was initially made by Twitter but devs went on independent path.

- Go to this [link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) and scroll down to get the starter template and copy it.

- We can download it and install it into our Django app but we won't be doing that instead we will just copy the starter template.

- It has all the stuff we need that it will be needing through a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

- Check out some of the components of bootstrap [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/alerts/).
