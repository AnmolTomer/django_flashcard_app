# Creating web forms

- Now we are done with creation of framework, linking URLs etc. of our webpage.

- Next thing we want to do is create web forms so that we can answer the questions.

- Go to this [link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/forms/) and you will see Bootstrap has some cool forms that we can use.

- Copy the form starter code and let's modify add.html first.

- Change `btn-primary` to `btn-secondary` to go with the general theme of the website.

- Remove check me out section.

- Add the modified starter code with email and password removed to all four math pages.
